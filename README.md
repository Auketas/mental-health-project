# mental-health-project
A project done to visualize and analyze mental health data from Sweden to 1) assess relationships between Covid-19 and mental health and 2) assess temporal trends in mental health diagnoses as well as patterns in age and gender
The file 'Graphs' can be run in R to execute the visualizations for incidence rate of various types of mental health diagnoses. Note that the data is not real but simulated. In the Graphs file in line 12 and 63 where it says "c:/Users/test" the user has to insert the path where he/she wants the graphs to be stored.
